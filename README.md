## Develop mode

To develop locally, a previous configuration must be carried out. The first obviously is to clone the repository.
The next point is to create a ".env" file with the following structure:
```
TOKEN=Add bot token here 
API_TOKEN=Api token 
PREFIX=Prefix (For example: !, -, ., <, ...)
```
To get a bot token you need to create a new application on the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
The api token is something that is still in development and is intended to be replaced by JWT, for the moment a secret word / code is used to suit the user.
And finally, the prefix is by which the bot will take into account that what is written to it is a command for it, by default it is "!", But it can be modified.
